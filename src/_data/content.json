When you're asked to explain the distinction between the two, here's a helpfully pithy summation: Digitalization is about taking an existing process within a business and making it cheaper and more efficient using digital tools and technology. Enacting digitalization does not make a business a digital one, however. That requires digital transformation, which has the grander goal of harnessing technology and data to enhance the business model, energize workplace culture, and, most importantly, create new value for customers.
